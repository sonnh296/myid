      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>I'm here to greet you with a warm hello.</p>
      <p>
        I am Nguyen Hong Son, a developer from Viet Nam currently living in Ha
        Noi. <br />
        I have worked with some programming languages such as C/C++, Java, C#,
        Javascript, Python, etc. Besides their frameworks. <br />
        But I found that it doesn't matter what languages you use, the most
        important things are the coding mindset, design, architecture, and the
        way you solve the problem. <br />
        <br />
        I have some valuable experiences in developing applications, so I can
        tell you what you can do to make your skills better and you can imagine
        how this shit work with each other. Like some features in many
        frameworks just have different names but the same purposes. <br />
        You can find me at <a href="https://github.com/sonnh296">github</a>,
